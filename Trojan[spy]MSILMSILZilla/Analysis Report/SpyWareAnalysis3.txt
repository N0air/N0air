With all these information we are still not sure how these passwords are decrpted. So Lets take a look at the Resource Section. 

Remember while exploring the RecoverBrowser() function we came accross ReadFile(). WithIn ReadFile we found 

"Óµ.ØØØØ(executablePath, text3, Encryption.RSMDecrypt(array, bytes), false);" which has one more function RSMDecrypt() this returns Array.
So now lets try to explore what that Array Contains. 

Lets set to the breadkpoints to below lines: 

1. string text2 = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData), "Browsers.txt");

2. Óµ.ØØØØ(executablePath, text3, Encryption.RSMDecrypt(array, bytes), false);

3. Rfc2898DeriveBytes rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(ƄƏƵÉ, new byte[8], 1);

When you hit the breakpoint 3. You can see the value of Array. Below in the screenshot you can see that after taking the dump of  the 
value of Array, its a PE file.
