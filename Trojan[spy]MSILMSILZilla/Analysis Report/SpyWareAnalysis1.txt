Found this piece of Malware. When Unzipped with the password : crackinglessons.com, it exactrated a file with the extension
.bin. Made a Hash : a850de0705c0f6095910aa1d5ed0e73a49581aa7427fcfaf2ff5144e93b047c1 and did a quick search in Virus Total, 
found out that its a SpyWare with the name : Trojan[spy]:MSIL/MSILZilla. 


Static Analysis : 

This got me qurious, so I did a Static Analysis, trying to figure out the strings, any DNS addresses, passwords, Keys. Well, 
as expected, most of the Malwares are packed. So No luck with the string search. 

Next step, with just knowing that this piece of program is a Syware, I did a Capa Query. Which game me the file hashes, file format, Architecture
Intrestingly, when i was going through the output, I found that this spyware uses .NET to access, allocate and manipulate memory. 
Also it uses .NET to find data using Regex. 

Key Indicators : 
KeyLogging
find data using regex in .NET
read clipboard data
Send and Receive Data using Command and Control Server. 

I think we have enough data using Static Analysis. So far, I know this is a .NET file, an excuitable. Which when excuited 
sends and receive data for C&C machine. Isn't this a cliche ? Practically every Malware does this. Anyway, lets try to do some 
Dynamic Analysis now 


Dynamic Analysis : 

After Spawning multiple tools to track files created and deleted, to caputre any dns reqeusts, register entries, process creation
below are the key points observed. 

Our beloved SpyWare dropped 3 files immidiately after execution :
1. C:\ProgramData\Mails.txt
2. C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\bhv368C.tmp
3. C:\ProgramData\Browsers.txt

Also, it tried to connect to 2 DNS : 

49.13.77.253 -> ziraat-helpdesk.com	
131.107.255.255 - > dns.msftncsi.com	

Did a quick IP lookup on the IP : 49.13.77.253  Below are the results : 

Decimal:822955517
Hostname:static.253.77.13.49.clients.your-server.de
ASN:24940
ISP:Hetzner Online GmbH
Services:Datacenter
Assignment:Likely Static IP
Country:Germany
State/Region:Sachsen
City:Falkenstein
Latitude:50.4779 (50° 28′ 40.27″ N)
Longitude:12.3716 (12° 22′ 17.63″ E)

So Far Summary : 

1. Drops the executable file immediately after the start
2. Steals credentials
3. Actions looks like stealing of personal data
4. Uses NirSoft utilities to collect credentials
5. Steals credentials from Web Browsers
6. C&C Might be in Germany, Falkenstein.

Since we have some idea has to "What" this SpyWare does after excuition, lets try to understand "How" it does what it does.Next 
stop, REVERSE ENGINEERING !!! Such a cool thing to say !!
